The study explores the feasibility of using Liquid Organic Hydro Carriers (LOHC) and Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFC) for marine applications. The research presents a case study of LOHC storage, distribution, and PEMFC consumption on a 100m coastal general cargo vessel. The analysis covers national infrastructure requirements, port interfaces, operational profile modeling, and integration complexity. The study assesses the applicability for marine usage based on fuel economy, safety, modular scaling, and redundancy factors. The life-cycle economics are comparable or favorable to conventional options, subject to incremental upstream investments. The study concludes that LOHC-PEM systems have technical promise and infrastructure synergies for sustainable marine fuels, but rigorous testing and qualification are crucial before commercial deployment.
